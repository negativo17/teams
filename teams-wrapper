# The spotify binary has a RUNPATH of its origin folder. It requires a few
# librares compiled with minimum options (no external dependencies).
# The FFMpeg library is loaded ONLY on the system path libraries, ignoring the
# RUNPATH.

# So remove the RUNPATH from the binary, put all the libraries in its private
# folder and make sure that only the spotify binary can access them.
